### 2. Reset Password Flow
- **Route**: `/auth/reset-password`
- **Features**:
  - Verification code validation from Firebase
  - Strong password requirements enforcement
  - Real-time password strength indicator
  - Show/hide password functionality
  - Automatic redirect after successful reset

## Password Security Requirements

### Strong Password Policy
All passwords must meet the following criteria:
- Minimum 8 characters long
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
- Cannot contain common patterns or sequences
- Cannot be a commonly used password

### Password Strength Indicator
- Real-time visual feedback during password creation
- Color-coded strength levels (Weak/Medium/Strong)
- Individual requirement checklist
- Prevents submission until all requirements are met

## Authentication Security Features

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **Login Attempts**: Maximum 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP/email
- **Password Reset**: Limited requests per IP address
- **Registration**: Rate limiting to prevent spam accounts
- Automatic lockout with exponential backoff

### 2. Security Logging
All authentication events are logged including:
- Successful logins
- Failed login attempts
- Password reset requests
- Password changes
- Account registrations
- Suspicious activities

### 3. Session Management
- Secure session handling with Firebase Auth
- Automatic session timeout
- Session validation on sensitive operations
- Secure logout functionality

## Firebase Integration Security

### 1. Authentication Rules
- Email/password authentication with strong validation
- Google OAuth integration with account linking
- Secure password reset flow using Firebase Auth
- Email verification support

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Security logs - admin only
    match /security_logs/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.token.email in ['admin@shreejimalta.com', 'krishsorthrex@gmail.com'];
    }
    
    // User data - owner only
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Environment Security
- All Firebase credentials stored in environment variables
- Secure API key management
- Production vs development environment separation

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Security Dashboard
- **Route**: `/admin/security` (Admin only)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time security event monitoring
  - Failed login attempt tracking
  - Password reset activity monitoring
  - Suspicious activity alerts
  - Time-based filtering (24h, 7d, 30d)

### 2. Security Metrics
- Total successful logins
- Failed login attempts
- Password reset requests
- New registrations
- Suspicious activity count

### 3. Event Types Tracked
- `login_success`: Successful user login
- `login_failed`: Failed login attempt
- `registration_success`: New account created
- `registration_failed`: Failed registration attempt
- `password_reset_requested`: Password reset email sent
- `password_reset_completed`: Password successfully reset
- `suspicious_activity`: Potential security threat detected

## API Security

### 1. Secure Endpoints
- **Password Reset API**: `/api/auth/password-reset`
- Rate limiting implemented
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure error handling
- CSRF protection

### 2. Admin APIs
- Authentication required for all admin endpoints
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Secure data transmission

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- Email format validation
- Password strength validation
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention (using Firestore)

### 2. Error Handling
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed logging for debugging (server-side only)
- User-friendly error messages
- No sensitive data in client-side errors

### 3. Data Protection
- Passwords hashed by Firebase Auth
- Sensitive data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Secure cookie handling

### 4. UI/UX Security
- Clear security indicators
- Password visibility toggle
- Security recommendations
- User education about security practices
