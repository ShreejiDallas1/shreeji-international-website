# Security Notice

## Environment Variables

**CRITICAL**: The `.env.local` file contains sensitive credentials and should NEVER be committed to version control.

### Setup Instructions:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Replace all placeholder values with your actual credentials
3. Ensure `.env.local` is listed in `.gitignore` (already done)
4. Never commit `.env.local` to version control

### Sensitive Data Included:
- Firebase API keys and configuration
- Google Service Account private keys
- Square payment credentials (sandbox and production)
- API keys for various services

### Security Recommendations:

1. **Rotate all credentials** shown in the current `.env.local` file
2. Use environment-specific credentials (dev/staging/production)
3. Implement proper secret management in production
4. Regular security audits of dependencies
5. Monitor for credential leaks

### Production Deployment:

- Use secure environment variable management (Vercel, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Never expose sensitive keys to client-side code
- Implement proper CORS and rate limiting
- Use HTTPS only
- Regular security updates

## Vulnerability Fixes Applied:

- ✅ Removed vulnerable `squareup` package
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors that could lead to runtime issues
