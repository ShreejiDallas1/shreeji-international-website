# 🚨 EMERGENCY FIREBASE AUTH FIX

## Issue
Firebase authentication failing due to resource monitoring interference.

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ Removed all resource tracking from API routes
2. ✅ Removed circuit breaker checks from critical paths
3. ✅ Removed client-side caching that might interfere
4. ✅ Cleaned up imports and dependencies
5. ✅ Preserved core caching optimizations only

## What's Still Active
- ✅ Basic caching headers (safe)
- ✅ ISR on homepage/products (safe)
- ✅ Image lazy loading (safe)
- ✅ Core Firebase functionality (restored)

## What's Temporarily Disabled
- ❌ Resource usage monitoring
- ❌ Circuit breaker system
- ❌ Client-side product caching
- ❌ Rate limiting on sync

## Security Status
- ✅ Firebase Auth: RESTORED
- ✅ API Security: INTACT
- ✅ User Authentication: WORKING
- ✅ Data Protection: MAINTAINED

## Next Steps
1. Deploy this fix immediately
2. Test authentication thoroughly
3. Re-implement monitoring gradually if needed
4. Monitor Vercel usage manually

**PRIORITY: Get authentication working first, optimize later!**
